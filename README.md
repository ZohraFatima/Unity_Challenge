As per the given tasks the tasks that I was able to complete successfully are -->
Creating the cube,ground and 4 walls,
Moving the cube with arrow keys
Colliding the cube with the walls and changing the colors
Setting a time of 1.5 minutes and as the timer starts (Timestamp,X,Y,Z,Wall_name) starts getting recorded in the csv file.
As the timeer stops the csv file closes and saves the values.
Then again the csv files open to get the x,z cordinates to plot the graph.

However there are two tasks where I am lagging
The graph is not plotted sucessfully, I feel the issue is with my design of thr graph and slightly in the code.Please check my grpah code.
Secondly. the cube once it collides with any wall it starts floating in the air, I tried to turn on kinematics to prevent this, it was working but then collision was not working so I turned off 
the kinematics property. Hence the cube is floating after collision.

Please look into my code.
